 ## Agile Development

PlanIt was developed over the course of 15 days using accelerated agile practices. After [an initial proposal was written](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hBv6paUUFhn35rVdWqoev71b5fatHQhRAZT3lOJyUSE/edit?usp=sharing), the team collaboratively participated in an "inception" process. After an initial 'Determine The Relationship' meeting, the team "brain-dumped" all their feature proposals then went through a feature prioritization process in order to determine which would be part of the "minimum viable product" (MVP).

After establishing goals, communication plans, project management conventions, the team decided to use a Miro for project management, and have daily stand-up meetings and weekly retrospective meetings. The team met with a project manager and a project mentor every three days for check-ins and communicated with them regularly via Slack.
